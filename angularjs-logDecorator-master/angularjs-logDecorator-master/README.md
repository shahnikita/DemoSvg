## AngularJS LogX 

LogX provides an extended version to AngularJS $log utilities to deliver logging output similar to:

<br/>
Originally published as a set of classes that must be manually cloned and intergrated into each project, this repository has evolved and now has multiple purposes:

1.  Configured as the GitHub source for the Bower component `angular-logX`
2.  Provides source code, build scripts for the `angluar-logX` library/component
3.  Provides examples of manually using the $log decorator classes: Demos #1 - #4
4.  Provides an example of using the Bower **angular-logX** component with its `mindspace.logX` angular module. See the custom SPA: **Demo #5**

---

### Using/Installing the Bower Component 

Simple use the Bower command to install this component (angular-logX module/library) within your AMD SPA application

```txt
bower install angular-logX --save
```
Which will install the release library code as a Bower package. 

Afterwards, developers can use the following AngularJS plugins (for logging)  within their own AngularJS SPAs:

1. Concatenated : `/angular-logX/release/amd/angular-logX.js`
2. Minified : `/angular-logX/release/amd/angular-logX.min.js`


> It is important to note that currently only an AMD library is available for use within AngularJS Browser SPA applications. <br/>This means that custom SPA(s) using `/release/amd/angular-logx.js` must use **RequireJS**. <br/>Future releases will provide CommonJS versions [for NodeJS apps] and UMD versions of the library.


Developers should be aware that when the component is installed with Bower (as shown above), the pre-build source is not available. Full source is available within the Git repository; so clone it and *play*.

--- 

### Use the Source Code and build the AMD Library (locally)

The `angular-logX` library is deployed as a concatenated AMD library. To build the library (and its minified version), clone the repository locally and open a Terminal window to execute the following commands.

1. Install the **Grunt** libraries ```npm update```
2. Build the libraries using ```Grunt``` 

The new compiled libraries are deployed to:

1.  ```./release/amd/*.js```
2.  ```./demos/webroot/assets/vendor/angular-logX/release/amd``` 


> Future versions for deploying as CommonJS libraries will be available soon...


<br/>
### Repository and Demos

If you clone the repository, the demos/build directory has its own Bower scripts to install all Bower vendor libraries needed to run the demo SPAs.
These libraries will be installed within  `demos/webroot/assets/vendor/`.

If you run a webserver with its webroot set to `./demos/webroot` you can explore the Demos and their console output.

### Demo #5 - Using the AngularJS Enhanced Logging Plugin

Demo #5 (bootstrap.js) shows an example of how to use the Logging classes within your own SPA.

*  First we load the script using `head.js( )`. 
*  Then simply include the *Enhanced Logging* module dependency `mindspace.logX` when we configure the AngularJS SPA.

<br/>

```js
    var pluginURL = "/assets/vendor/angular-logX/release/amd/" ;
    head.js(

      { angular      : "/assets/vendor/angular/angular.js"  },
      { require      : "/assets/vendor/requirejs/require.js" },
      { logX :  pluginURL + "angular-logX.min.js"  }

    )
    .ready( "ALL", function() {

        // Dynamically load the application files...

        require.config (
        {
        	appDir  : '',
        	baseUrl : '/src/demo/5',
        	paths   :
        	{
                'utils'        : 'myApp/utils',
                 'mindspace.utils' : '/assets/vendor/angular-logX/release/amd/angular-logX.min'
        	},
            bundles: {
                'mindspace.utils': [
                    // List external AMDs that are known
                    'mindspace/logger/ExternalLogger',
                    'mindspace/utils/supplant',
                    'mindspace/utils/makeTryCatch'
                ]
            }
        });


        /**
         * Specify main application dependencies...
         * one of which is the Authentication module.
         */
        var dependencies = [
                'myApp/services/Authenticator',
                'myApp/controllers/LoginController'
            ],
            appName = 'myApp.Application';

        /**
         * Now let's start our AngularJS app...
         * which uses RequireJS to load the sxm packages and code
         */
        require( dependencies, function ( $log, Authenticator, LoginController )
        {
            /**
             * Start the main application; include dependency on the Enhanced Logging plugin
             * `mindspace.logX`
             */

            angular.module(     appName,           [ 'mindspace.logX' ]   )
                   .value(      "session",         { sessionID : null }    )
                   .factory(    "authenticator",   Authenticator           )
                   .controller( "LoginController", LoginController         );
        });

    });
```
